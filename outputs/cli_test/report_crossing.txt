RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Modify mission waypoints to avoid conflict zones
- Consider altitude adjustments if conflicts are near same Z-level
- Reschedule mission (temporal deconfliction not yet implemented)
- Contact air traffic coordination for assistance

NOTE: This report reflects SPATIAL analysis only. Temporal deconfliction
      (time-based separation) has not been implemented yet.
